# Soldiers! Time to war!

### Just a simple game i'm making.

- You need to defend your position while hordes of enemies come into battle.
- There's no objective except for survive the longest you can.
- Score the most and thrive :)

## To do:

[x] Base game;
[x] Player movement;
[x] Enemies (partially done, as i want to implement new ones);
[x] OOP to make things easier;
[x] Menus (also partially, as i need to add functionalities to some of them);
[ ] Music and sound effects;
[ ] New (and better) sprites;
[ ] Particles? Maybe;
[ ] Polish (yeah for some reason this crap is stuttering sometimes);
[ ] Check what improvements can be made to methods/classes;
[ ] Add content xD.

- That's basically this, feel free to _steal_ _ i mean _ use the code, though i don't recommend it because there's probably a better way to do it.

:)
